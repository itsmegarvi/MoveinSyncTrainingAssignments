 //This approach might not work considering the order might keep coming later on.
    // We cant be sending the same list with just addition of one order everytime to chef.

    //What can be the alternatives:
    //Instead of sending the list to chef,
    // We can make a queue in chef that when not empty starts cooking
            // But for this we might also want a function that on addition to queue returns order no. + order place time
    //If we do this with priority queue then there would be a function doing totally different jobs

    //In conclusion, it seems till we are not clear about how to solve the main problem, the rest will be subject to change and a
    //waste of time in my opinion

    //Also am in love with big monitor coding
    // I want it I want it I want it

    main
    //just thought of something
            //If we are making a constructor for waiter and making it do the job of reaching to the chef it will take a lot of objects
            //And that is inefficient, so this should be a function 1 waiter unless specified presence of more
